# Local Social Networking Protocol (LSNP)

**Authors:**  
- Morales, Alejandro Jose E.
- Ruiz, Joseph Benjamin P.

A decentralized peer-to-peer social networking application over UDP. Designed for use in LAN environments, LSNP allows users to post messages, chat privately, share files, create groups, and play games â€” all without centralized servers.

## Features

- **Peer Discovery** via PING and PROFILE messages
- **Messaging**
  - Public POST
  - Private DM
  - FOLLOW / UNFOLLOW
  - LIKE / UNLIKE
- **File Sharing**
  - Chunked file transfer using FILE_OFFER, FILE_CHUNK, FILE_RECEIVED
- **Group Messaging**
  - Group creation, updates, and messaging (GROUP_CREATE, GROUP_UPDATE, GROUP_MESSAGE)
- **Game Support**
  - Tic Tac Toe with turn-based invites and result reporting
- **Token-based Access Control**
  - Scopes: broadcast, chat, file, follow, group, game
- **Verbose Logging Mode**

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- No external libraries required

### Running the Peer

bash
python main.py


Multiple threads will start for:
- Listening for incoming messages
- Periodic PING/PROFILE broadcast
- Cleaning up stale file offers
